This repository contains my notes from studying Machine Learning as a beginner with a materials science background. The notes primarily cover theoretical concepts in AI and its applications in materials science.

⚙️ Practice code is still in progress — I’m working on it! 🥹

🔄 Update

I’m currently diving into quantum mechanics, aiming to explore high-throughput computational methods for accurate property prediction. At the same time, I’m learning about Machine Learning Force Fields and AI for Quantum Chemistry (AIQC).

Fitting wavefunctions using ML seems to be a promising approach to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. I’ll be uploading relevant notes as I gain more understanding.
