# ML-for-Materials-notes

My notes from studying **Machine Learning** with a **materials science** background as a beginner. These files mainly contain **theoretical knowledge** about AI and AI for materials.  
🛠️ Practical code is still in progress (I'm working on it! 🥹)

## 🔄 Incoming Updates

I'm currently learning **quantum mechanics** and exploring **high-throughput computational methods** to calculate material properties more accurately. I'm also trying to understand:

- **Machine Learning Force Fields**
- **AI for Quantum Chemistry (AIQC)**

Fitting **wavefunctions** might be a good approach to balance **accuracy** and **computational cost**.

📌 I’ll continue to publish notes as I make progress.  
💡 Also looking for advice and feedback from the community! 🥰
